  `A game engine is essentially the core software that game developers
use to create video games. It's a specialized toolset that provides
various functionalities like rendering graphics, handling physics,
managing audio, and implementing artificial intelligence. Think of
it as a foundation or framework upon which games are built.`,
  `Instead of starting from scratch each time, developers use a game
engine to streamline the process. It offers pre-built systems and
libraries that allow them to focus on designing the game itself
rather than reinventing the wheel with each new project. It's a bit
like using a template or a set of tools to construct a
houseâ€”developers utilize the engine's capabilities to shape their
unique gaming experiences.`,
